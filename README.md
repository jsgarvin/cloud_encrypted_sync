# Cloud Encrypted Sync

> Cloud Encrypted Sync is pre-alpha and not ready for use, yet.  Stay tuned, or fork and play.

> Core functionality is (apparently) all completed and tests are passing. The only thing to do 
is the CLI.

Cloud Encrypted Sync is a command line tool distributed as a Ruby gem for syncing a local
folder to cloud storage (currently only supports S3), with localy managed encryption (you
control the keys).

Even though you could simply use Cloud Encrypted Sync to backup a local folder to the cloud, 
it's orignial intended purpose is to sync a folder across multiple computers, so it should work
for that, too.
